-------------------------------------------

ChangeLog

CVS HEAD           Bugfix: _lscp_client_evt_proc() dropped LSCP events.

                   Bugfix in lscp_client_subscribe(): only the first
                   lscp_client_subscribe() call succeeded (per client),
                   all subsequent ones failed.

                   Added support for new (un)subscribable events:
                     LSCP_EVENT_CHANNEL_MIDI
                     LSCP_EVENT_DEVICE_MIDI
                   Caution: the bitflag approach for the event variable
                   is now abondoned, since otherwise we would soon hit the
                   limit of the bit range. The bitflag approach will
                   remain for events older at this point (that is all
                   events which occupy the lower 16 bits), but this new
                   and all following events will simply be enumared along
                   the upper 16 bits.

                   Added new client interface function, for renaming
                   effect send entities:
                     lscp_set_fxsend_name();

0.5.5  2007-10-12  Changed client interface function, for editing
                   instrument, from:
                     lscp_edit_instrument();
                   to:
                     lscp_edit_channel_instrument();

0.5.4  2007-10-02  Added new client interface function, for editing
                   instrument:
                     lscp_edit_instrument();

                   Fixed some minor bugs in:
                     lscp_set_fxsend_midi_controller();
                     lscp_set_fxsend_level();

0.5.3  2007-01-15  Added new client interface functions, for sampler
                   channel effect sends control:
                     lscp_set_fxsend_midi_controller();
                     lscp_set_fxsend_level();

                   Added new field member to lscp_fxsend_info_t (level).

0.5.2  2007-01-11  Added new client interface functions, for sampler
                   channel effect sends control:
                     lscp_create_fxsend();
                     lscp_destroy_fxsend();
                     lscp_get_fxsends();
                     lscp_list_fxsends();
                     lscp_get_fxsend_info();
                     lscp_set_fxsend_audio_channel();
                   and for global volume:
                     lscp_get_volume();
                     lscp_set_volume();

                   Audio routing representation changed to integer array.

0.5.1  2006-12-22  Added support for new (un)subscribable events:
                     LSCP_EVENT_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE_COUNT,
                     LSCP_EVENT_AUDIO_OUTPUT_DEVICE_INFO,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INPUT_DEVICE_COUNT,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INPUT_DEVICE_INFO,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INSTRUMENT_MAP_COUNT,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INSTRUMENT_MAP_INFO,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INSTRUMENT_COUNT,
                     LSCP_EVENT_MIDI_INSTRUMENT_INFO.
 
                   Updated examples.

0.5.0  2006-12-17  MIDI instrument mapping, second round, according to
                   LSCP 1.2 draft document as of December 15, 2006.

                   New client interface functions:
                     lscp_set_channel_midi_map();
                     lscp_add_midi_instrument_map();
                     lscp_remove_midi_instrument_map();
                     lscp_get_midi_instrument_maps();
                     lscp_list_midi_instrument_maps();
                     lscp_get_midi_instrument_map_name();
                     lscp_set_midi_instrument_map_name();


0.4.2  2006-12-04  MIDI instrument mapping fixed, previously missing
                   the regular ON_DEMAND load mode.

                   Server error reporting is now effective; all server
                   numerical error and warning codes are added to 100,
                   thus giving a proper non-zero lscp_client_get_errno()
                   return value.

0.4.1  2006-11-28  Fixed the flush timeout operation to be issued only
                   once, avoiding recurrent client failure after receive
                   timeout.

                   Support for very long command result sets have been
                   introduced, with the downside of strictly obeying
                   the LSCP draft.

                   list_midi_instruments() is now being implemented.

                   LGPL text is now back in COPYING.

0.4.0  2006-11-27  As of the LSCP 1.2 working draft document, added
                   some missing client interface functions:
                     lscp_get_total_voice_count();
                     lscp_get_total_voice_count_max();
                   and for the new MIDI instrumenbt mapping features:
                     lscp_map_midi_instrument();
                     lscp_unmap_midi_instrument();
                     lscp_get_midi_instruments();
                     lscp_get_midi_instrument_info();
                     lscp_clear_midi_instruments();


0.3.4  2006-09-24  GPL address update.

0.3.3  2006-06-01  Fixed some compilation warnings due to suspicious type
                   casting and unsused header macros.

                   Changed deprecated copyright attribute to license
                   and added ldconfig to post-(un)install steps
                   to liblscp.spec (RPM).

0.3.2  2005-08-29  Fixed missing initialization bug on lscp_channel_info_t
                   new struct fields (mute/solo).

                   Include debian files into distribution.

                   Renamed configure.in to newer configure.ac.

0.3.1  2005-08-16  [bug #21] Fixed automake support for separate build
                   directory.

                   Added support to sampler channel MUTE/SOLO states:
                     lscp_set_channel_mute();
                     lscp_set_channel_solo();
                   with corresponding new lscp_channel_info_t fields.

0.3.0  2005-06-10  [bug #11] Timeout flush idiosyncrasy is now a feature;
                   this just tries to flush the receive buffer whenever
                   any previous transaction has failed due to a timeout.

                   Fixed an off-by-one timeout quirk, that has been a real
                   showstopper on Mac OS X at least, which is incidental
                   to qsampler's default timeout setting of 1000 msecs,
                   giving up systematically on select() due to "Invalid
                   argument" (EINVAL).


0.2.8  2005-05-22  More LSCP command syntax changes, particularly on the
                   event subscription ones: the LSCP_EVENT_CHANNELS event
                   definition were renamed to LSCP_EVENT_CHANNEL_COUNT,
                   as to be more meaningful. Added support for the newest
                   LSCP command: GET SERVER INFO; lscp_get_server_info().

0.2.8  2005-05-08  [bug #9] Fixed for a LSCP command syntax convention 
                   consistency, regarding the enumeration of available 
                   sampler engines, Audio and MIDI drivers; this has 
                   affected the signature of the following functions:
                     lscp_get_available_engines();
                     lscp_get_available_audio_drivers();
                     lscp_get_available_midi_drivers();
                   which are now returning an integer count of engines
                   and drivers, respectively, while the following 
                   functions are now being introduced:
                     lscp_list_available_engines();
                     lscp_list_available_audio_drivers();
                     lscp_list_available_midi_drivers();
                   taking on the previous functionality, returning
                   a comma separated list of names.

0.2.7  2005-03-10  Mini bitsy regression; a severe crash (segfault)
                   was fixed on the device configuration functions:
                     lscp_set_audio_device_param();
                     lscp_set_midi_device_param();
                     lscp_set_audio_channel_param();
                     lscp_set_midi_port_param();

0.2.6  2005-03-01  Fixed nasty off-by-one bug on internal helpers.

0.2.5  2005-02-14  Added support for the new INSTRUMENT_NAME field
                   of GET CHANNEL INFO command.

0.2.4  2004-10-11  Fixed lscp_set_channel_midi_channel() again, MIDI
                   channels should be given in the range 0-15, and omni
                   mode with the LSCP_MIDI_CHANNEL_ALL symbol (16).

                   Fixed lscp_get_channel_info() to parse MIDI omni
                   (ALL) channels mode.

0.2.3  2004-09-28  Fixed lscp_set_channel_midi_channel() where MIDI
                   channels should be given in the range 1-16, and
                   omni mode with the new LSCP_MIDI_CHANNEL_ALL
                   symbol (0).

                   Rearrangement on main command requester executive.

0.2.2  2004-07-29  In sync with LSCP document draf (v.12).

                   New functions added: lscp_client_get_events() and
                   lscp_reset_sampler().

                   Added support for generating Debian packages;
                   renamed pkg-config lib name 'liblscp' -> 'lscp' as
                   it's common practice to omit the 'lib' prefix.

0.2.1  2004-07-09  Potential cripling defects habve been fixed.

0.2.0  2004-07-06  New LSCP extension draft (v.11) initial support.
                   (still a work in progress...)


0.1.9  2004-05-18  More fixes for MSVC++ example build.

0.1.8  2004-05-17  Fix for MSVC++ example build; snprintf replaced by
                   buffer overflow friendlier sprintf.

0.1.7  2004-05-10  Missing version.h now included on install; WIN32 is
                   only now conditionally defined.

0.1.6  2004-05-04  WIN32 build support; LPGL disclaimer consistency;
                   versioning functions introduced.

0.1.5  2004-04-26  Server stuff moved into examples.

0.1.4  2004-04-24  Initial auto/libtool preparation.
